Goal:
This project targets to setup a framework to auto-test web-app, native-mobile-app, and hybrid-mobile-app.
It supports the following testing env.:
1. web app: Chrome, Firefox;
2. native mobile app: iphone, Android, iphone simulator, Android emulator;
3. hybrid mobile app: iphone Safari, Android Chrome;

Techologies:
1. Selenium/Appium to auto-test web-app/mobile-app;
2. POM (Page Object Model) to make UI locators re-usable, improve readibility of UI test cases, and make UI test cases more maintainable;
3. Cucumber to integrate behavior-driven-development to make test steps re-usable, improve readibility of UI test cases, and make test cases easier for debugging;
4. Cucable: parallel execute scenarios in BDD to make faster UI testing and better testing reports;
